# Github trending repositories Application:

My application intent is to deal with GitHub trending repositories, I designed and developed it, in order to make more of experience with Microservices architectures, clean architecture and clean code. So to better design the backend, I follow the ddd pattern, so I divide the backend into two Microservices, one for authentication and accounts creating for users, and the other one for dealing with trending repositories. And then I create the front end with angular and it's modules.
The application allow users to :
1. create their accounts.
2. sign In to the application. 
- ***allowed signed in to :***
3. consult programming languages used by trending repositories. 
3.  read more about a specific language statistics by consulting it's a number of repositories and repositories information like stars number and owner.
